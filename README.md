# Linear-and-Circular-Convolution-using-FFT

This program demonstrates:
- The speedup obtained by using FFTs in numerical convolution. The two sequences x and y must contain at least 1000 elements each. The convolution code is written on own and libraries are used for the FFT computation. The speedup is documented using TIC TOC. 
- The errors between circular convolution using FFTs and linear convolution (direct computation) is documented. In both (i) and (ii), 5 sets of random x and y sequences are used.
